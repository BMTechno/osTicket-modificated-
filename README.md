# osTicket-modificated-
Modificated source version of osticket

### Modifications are fixes to functions from original version.. which we dont like ;)
+ When click button 'Post Reply' to stay on the same page to see you message..
+ Added preview button for messages to be previewed with header and footer before send
+ With this modification everybody can change ticket status to answered, not only department manager!!
+ Send attachments when create tickets, previously could only from response message and not from reason message. FIXED
